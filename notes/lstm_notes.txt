Meeting notes
Pytorch dataset function?
Divide data into batches yourself for pytorch lstm
One hot encoding
Perhaps start generating a sentence
He will provide data set at some point
Dataset will likely require some preprocessing
Perhaps Colab is not necessary
Perhaps try both convolutional network and lstm
t-sne dimensionality reduction
