In our project, one of the model we use is a convolutional neural network(CNN). CNN's are strong tools for classification of feature maps, which will be described below. In a CNN, the input data goes through one or more layers, where each neuron in each layer is applied with convolutional operations, which are fed to adjacent layers - forming a fully connected neural network layer. \\

\noindent
In our case, each amino acid will be represented as a neuron in the neural network's input layer. Since it's a fully connected network, each neurons' value, is calculated by looking at all neurons from the previous layer. This means that each neuron takes the entire sequence as input - applying its weights and then passes it through an activation function. By doing this, the model gets fit to detect important patterns in the sequence.
