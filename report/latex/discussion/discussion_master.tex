In this section, we'll be discussing our experiments and their results. We will also be discussing the models and how they perform compared to each other with the task of finding any representation of the proteins' structure. We will discuss our final model, and also how our models' results compare to the results from UniRep\cite{unirep} and Tape\cite{tape}.
