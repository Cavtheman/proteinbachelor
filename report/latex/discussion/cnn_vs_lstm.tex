In this project, the LSTM clearly outperforms the CNN in finding any representation of the the secondary structure and in predicting the stability scores. Meaning that the LSTM learned more insight of the internal structure. \\

\noindent
In general, an LSTM are very time consuming when looking at training time. Meaning there are some disadvantages of using an LSTM compared to a CNN.
