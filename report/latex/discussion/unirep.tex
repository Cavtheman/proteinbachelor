When looking at both the TAPE paper\cite{tape} and the Unirep paper\cite{unirep}, they have some conflicting information regarding the Spearman correlation they achieve when predicting stability scores. The Unirep paper says that they get a Spearman correlation score of $0.59$, but we could not find the dataset they used to get this on. We used the TAPE dataset, in whose paper they say that Unirep scores a significantly better $0.73$. With our best model's score of $0.627$ we would consider this a pretty good result. We also generated a TSNE plot with the output of this model, which can be compared to a similar Unirep model in Figure ~\ref{fig:unirep_comp}
