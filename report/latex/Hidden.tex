A neural network has units called neurons, these neurons are grouped into several layers. These layers are columns of neurons. Each neuron is connected to adjacent layers of neurons through connectors called weights. These weights are functions which are multiplied with the neurons and some bias between layers. These biases are meant to push these functions toward a specific output.
