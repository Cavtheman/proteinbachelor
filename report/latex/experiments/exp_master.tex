In this section, we'll discuss some experiments that we have performed with the two different models. The aim of these experiments was to see which hyperparameters have significant effects on how well the models train.

\subsubsection{Embeddings vs no embeddings} % Consider deleting if lacking time

\subsubsection{Layers vs no layers}

\subsubsection{Dropout vs. no dropout} % casper
